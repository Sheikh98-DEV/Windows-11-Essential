## 🔧 What is Windows 11 Essential?

Windows 11 Essential is a custom-built version of Windows 11, carefully stripped of non-essential features to deliver:

- Lower RAM usage
- Smaller disk footprint (~5 GB on C drive)
- Faster performance
- No telemetry or bloatware
- Full compatibility with Windows Update

Unlike many other modified builds, Essential is based on the **latest 24H2 release**, not outdated versions like 21H2. This ensures long-term support, security updates, and system stability.

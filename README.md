## ðŸ”§ What is Windows 11 Essential?

Windows 11 Essential is a custom-built version of Windows 11, carefully stripped of non-essential features to deliver:

- Lower RAM usage
- Smaller disk footprint (~5 GB on C drive)
- Faster performance
- No telemetry or bloatware
- Full compatibility with Windows Update

Unlike many other modified builds, Essential is based on the **latest 24H2 release**, not outdated versions like 21H2. This ensures long-term support, security updates, and system stability.

- **ISO Size:** ~4 GB  
- **Format Compatibility:** Can be flashed to FAT32 USB drives

## ðŸ§¹ Removed Components

Weâ€™ve removed unnecessary Store apps and background services that are typically considered *bloatware*.  
A full list of removed/disabled components is included in the download package.  
Users are encouraged to review this list before installation to ensure compatibility with their needs.

## ðŸ“Š Performance Benchmarks

In internal testing, we achieved:

- RAM usage as low as **1 GB**
- Only **70 background processes**
- ISO builds as small as **4 GB** (experimental, not stable)
- Only  **5 GB** of C Drive is occupied
These numbers reflect our commitment to performance â€” but we never sacrifice stability.  
Essential is built to last, not just to impress.
